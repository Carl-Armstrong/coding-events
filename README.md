# coding-events

// Purpose:
This app allows users to browse or post local events, keeping all users informed of upcoming coding events.

// Status:
Many functions are active and the app can be used for basic event tracking. Recently, tags have been enabled so events can be searched by
topic.

// Future updates:
Person class needs to be added to enable profiles to be created. Users will be able to view each other's profiles and see what events others
intend to attend and what tags others are interested in.
